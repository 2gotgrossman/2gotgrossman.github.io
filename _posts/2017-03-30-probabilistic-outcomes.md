title: Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Outcomes
---

*In creating a startup, “you can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.”* -- Peter Thiel


*"Outcomes are usually not deterministic…The popular definition of insanity—doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result—that's only true in a highly deterministic situation.”*
        -- Elon Musk

Two ideas that are at first glance dialectical, but with some thought can be reconciled. You have choice over choosing your path, but not whether you will reach your destination.

Thiel would still disagree with that claim; he would argue that complete commitment to an idea (with enough intelligence), will guarantee your success. This seems to be a purely dream state but with Trump as president, he has some anecdotal evidence. Although in its extreme form, it is false, complete commitment to an idea can be psychologically motivating. Belief that something has happen has the potential to increase the effort you put into making it happen.
