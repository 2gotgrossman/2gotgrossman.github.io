title: Habits

It pains me to see people that are controlled by bad habits. It’s so easy to over-eat, excessively consume social media, be addicted to our phones, or think obsessively. And it’s amazing to see people that have built good habits. It is hard but incredibly rewarding to exercise, meditate, sleep, and self-reflect in a consistent manner. We build good habits but slip into bad ones. 

Habits can give you super powers or they can be debilitating. Be mindful of the habits you form and take inventory often. Remember, we are what we repeatedly do.
