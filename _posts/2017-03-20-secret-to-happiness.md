title: The Secret to Happiness
---

Growing up, I remember my dad often saying, “Son, you know what the secret to happiness is? Lower your expectations.” And then he would laugh hysterically. Growing up (and heeding his advice), I would tell whoever asked that my dream job was being a hobo. But my mom told the other story: Always optimize, always improve, always strive for more.

I was a driven kid growing up and now, but still look to be happy. I wanted to be Elon Musk and had tried, but my happiness failed. I know I need balance on some level, but how to compromise their two views?

My view is that to be happy as a high achiever, the secret is to **have big goals with low expectations.** Strive to do a lot, but be content with failing.


As Larry Page says, have a healthy disregard for the impossible.
