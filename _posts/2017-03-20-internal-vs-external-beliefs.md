title: Internal vs. External Beliefs of Outcomes
---

*The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.*
   -- George Bernard Shaw



Outcomes are probabilistic, but how we think about them affect our actions. In my mind, the optimal is to have an Internal Belief and an External Belief on outcomes. The Internal Belief is that outcomes are deterministic. You should know how you want the world to unfold and to work as hard as you can to realize that world. Your External Belief, however, is to be that outcomes are probabilistic. Convey to others that things are probabilistic and that success isnâ€™t guaranteed and believe that. But internally contradict yourself. Know that you will succeed and work your butt off.
