title: The Toddler Questions That Never End
---


I've always identified with being a toddler. They've got their head in the right place: food and questions. In particular, I've always loved the recursive question "Why?" The question is simple, but the results can be profound.

Oftentimes, the answer parents give after the 5th why is "That's just the way it is" which signifies either (1) they are done with the questions or (2) they don't know. But in general, the more "why?"s you ask, the closer you are getting to a good question and and truth.

Asking the recursive "why?" can help you see how things interrelate. As Charlie Munger says, "In general, learning is most easily assimilated and used when people consistently hang their experience on a latticework of theory answering the question: Why?‚Äù Asking "why?" can help you see the bigger picture and how ideas intersect.

The recursive "why?" is especially useful when you don't understand. It can also help you see through BS. By asking someone enough "why?"s, you can easily see where someone's understanding is lacking or find contradictions.
